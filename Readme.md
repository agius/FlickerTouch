FlickrTouch
==================
A very, very simple Flickr browser built with [jQTouch](http://www.jqtouch.com/). An example instance is running at [http://atevansflickr.heroku.com/](http://atevansflickr.heroku.com/). Currently supports browsing recent images and search, and that's about it. Just an experiment to try combining a mobile web app framework, Sinatra, and experiment with the Flickr API. There are some bugs, mostly due to [jQTouch issues](http://atevans.com/jqtouch-problems) -- in the future, I may make a similar application with another framework instead.

If you want to build a simple, flickr-based mobile interface, this may be a good starting point.
